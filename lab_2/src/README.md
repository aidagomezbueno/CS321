# Project 2: Stardew Valley

* Author: Aida Gomezbueno Berezo

## Overview

In this project, the Priority Queue abstract data type is implemented and used, in representation of the MaxHeap structure, to simulate a priority level based task management algorithm.
 

## Reflection

The implementation of this project has been time-consuming and concept-dense. Not because of the theoretical terms per se, but because of what it means to index it in code already developed by an outsider and working with the various parties involved.

In itself, what I have dedicated more time to is the functionality of the binary tree MaxHeap, to all its methods and to make them work correctly, what I would dare to say is the core of the whole project, and at the same time what I have put more emphasis on. What I liked the least or what I found less attractive was the correct integration with the given code.


## Compiling and Using

There are two ways of compilation. On the one hand the tests and on the other hand the operation of the application or game.

To compile the test, the following must be entered from the src directory or folder of the project in the command line:

javac *.java

java MaxHeapTest

To compile the rest of the code:

javac *.java

bash runtests.sh

 
## Results

As for the results, these should correspond to those provided in the test-cases. In addition, unit tests of all the functionality of the MaxHeap class have been provided.
